                <p>Majority of our orders are handed over to our logistics partners within 1 working days of your order. For custom printed orders, once we receive your written approval of the artwork, it will take an additional 3 working days for printing. Orders above Rs.1500 will be shipped free of cost. For orders below Rs.1500, a nominal fee of Rs.149 would be applied.</p>
                <p>Once your order ships, a tracking number will be created. You can start tracking your order as soon as it has been shipped out. Alternatively, you can also login and visit the â€˜My Account' section to know your order status. Please provide an accurate email address if you would like to track your order. Creating an account, though not required, will facilitate the ability to track the package.</p>
                <p>U-Pack currently ships to over 6000 PIN codes across India for qualified orders. Depending upon your Pin Code, the shipping transit time varies between 3 to 9 working days. On each product page, you can enter your location's pin code and check when you can expect to receive the delivery. Sometimes, delivery time is subject to factors beyond our control, including but not limited to, unexpected travel delays from our courier partners due to weather conditions or any political disruptions or festivals or strikes. In such cases, U-Pack will not be held responsible. The delivery address cannot be changed once the order has been placed. </p>

                <p className='font-bold py-2 text-lg'>Remote Location Delivery:</p>
                <p>A surcharge is applied per shipment when the delivery destination location is remote (ODA). ODA is defined as PIN codes or a suburb/town that are distant, hard to access or infrequently served by major carriers. The delivery times for these ODA locations are significantly longer and additional charges are applicable per shipment. You will be explicitly advised about these charges and delivery estimate at the time of checkout if your delivery location falls in this category.</p>

                <p className='font-bold py-2 text-lg'>International Delivery:</p>
                <p>Right now, we do not deliver internationally. You can make a purchase from anywhere in the world using Indian currency as the mode of payment as long as the shipping address is within India.</p>
